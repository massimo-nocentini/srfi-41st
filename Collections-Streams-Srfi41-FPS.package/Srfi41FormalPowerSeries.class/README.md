!Formal power series

In mathematics, a formal power series is a generalization of a polynomial, where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite; this implies giving up the possibility of replacing the variable in the polynomial with an arbitrary number. Thus a formal power series differs from a polynomial in that it may have infinitely many terms, and differs from a power series, whose variables can take on numerical values. One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers. In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of x^{5} is the fifth term in the sequence. In combinatorics, formal power series provide representations of numerical sequences and of multisets, and for instance allow concise expressions for recursively defined sequences regardless of whether the recursion can be explicitly solved; this is known as the method of generating functions. More generally, formal power series can include series with any finite number of variables, and with coefficients in an arbitrary ring. Formal power series can be created from Taylor polynomials using formal moduli.
